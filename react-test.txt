Test Driven Development ( TDD )



Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test driven development is a software development process where you write tests
before writing the software code
Once the tests have been written, you then write the code to ensure the tests pass
1.
..
Create tests that verify the functionality of a specific feature
2.
Write software code that will run the tests successfully when re-executed
3.
Refactor the code for optimization while ensuring the tests continue to pass
Also called red-green testing as all tests go from a red failed state to a green
passed state





key words:

test

describe

expect



Filename Conventions


Code Coverage




Assertions

When writing tests, we often need to check values meet certain conditions.
Assertions decide if a test passes or fails
